## Features

- **Rust Analyzer Integration** 

- **Rust Crate: `cargo-nextest` Integration**

- **Codelldb Debugger Integration**




## Usage:

NOTE: By default it would use the default config for the context you are in, or if no config is present it would fallback to using `rust-analyzer` or `cargo` to run the command.

### Run 
- Go to `main.rs` or any `src/bin/*.rs` files or any `examples/*.rs` and press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

### Test
- Go to any test file or test function and press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>


### Doc test
- Go to any `lib.rs` file or any modules used on your library that has a doc block with assertion and press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>


### Debugging
- Add any breakpoint and press  press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

### Bench
- Go to `benches` folder or any `benches/*.rs` files and press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>


## Advanced Usage:

Sometimes `cargo` or `rust-analyzer` cannot determine the correct command to run. e.g. you want to run `cargo-leptos` or `dx`. In this case you can override the default config specific for the context and crates you are working on.


> Default Config are placed in `$HOME/.cargo-runner/config.toml`
> Per crate Config Override are placed in `.cargo-runner/config.toml`
