> No Unicorn and crab was harm during the creation of this tool.

## Requirements

- rust-analyzer
- codelldb

**NOTE**: if this are missing then the extension will not be loaded

## Features

- [x] **One Key to rule them all** - press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to run any command. (can be re-mapped in keyboard shortcuts)

- [x] **Rust Analyzer Integration** - all default commands are derived from rust-analyzer

- [x] **Cargo Toml Integration** - parse useful `Metadata`  from `Cargo.toml`

- [x] **Override $CARGO_HOME**  from vscode settings

- [x] **Rust Crate: `cargo-nextest` Integration** (optional) - faster way to run tests with multiple threads

- [x] **Codelldb Debugger Integration** - to debug your code

- [x] **Rust Analyzer Config Integration** - share same rust-analyzer config across all rust-analyzer commands

## Use cases

### Run

1. Run Main

- Go to your `main.rs` file and press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

2. Other Binaries

- Go to any `src/bin/*.rs` file or to any files declared as `[[bin]]` in `Cargo.toml` and press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

3. Examples

- Go to any `examples/*.rs` file and press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

> **NOTE**: **main() fn** would be the **fallback** scope on any file , if **main() fn** exists on that file, considering it as the parent module to run cargo commands on.

> Even if your are on **main.rs** and you **don't have**  **main() fn** , it would'nt run any cargo commands on that file.

This gives us the ability to run **cargo build** on any build.rs file even if `rust-analyzer` doesn't support it.

### Test

1. Create a test 

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }

    #[test]
    fn it_works_too() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
```

NOTE: The scope varies , if your cursor is on the **scope outside** any **fn test** , it would then go up its **parent module** and run all the tests in that module. In the example above it would run all test on **mod tests** as its parent module.

2.  Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> on any code block you want to run tests on

### Doc test

**WARNING**:  Doc test only works with a crate-type of `lib`

1. Add doc-test on a function e.g. `lib.rs`

```rust
///
/// ```rust
/// use common::add;
/// assert_eq!(add(1, 2), 3);
/// ```
pub fn add(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}
```

> doc-test works on any **function** or **method**, **Struct** , **Enum** and **Union** that has doc-block and code block of `rust`

NOTE: The scope varies , if you put your cursor on the **Struct** definition and that **Struct** has many doc-test on its **impl block** then it will run all of them. Same goes for **Enum** and **Union** .


2. Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to run `doc-tests`


### Debugging

1. Add breakpoint on a rust file e.g. `main.rs` or any other rust file

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!"); <!-- add break point here
}
```


2. Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to debug the program

Note: This would only work if `codelldb` is installed.

> **REMINDER:** You cannot **debug** any **benchmarks** or **doc-tests** , when you try to debug **benches** it would just run the **cargo bench**

### Bench

1. set version of rust to `nightly`

```sh
rustup override set nightly
```

2. Add to the root of the module e.g. `main.rs` 

Root module means

```rust
#![feature(test)]
extern crate test;
```

3. create a new bench fn

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use std::time::Duration;

    use test::Bencher;
    use tokio::{runtime::Runtime, time::sleep};

    #[bench]
    fn bench_async_example(b: &mut Bencher) {
        let runtime = Runtime::new().unwrap();

        b.iter(|| {
            runtime.block_on(async {
                sleep(Duration::from_millis(5000)).await;
                let x: u32 = (1..100).sum();
                x
            });
        });
    }
}
```

> **FEATURE** Supports `cargo-nextest` to run benchmarks



### Rust Analyzer Config Integration

1. Adding Cargo Arguments

- Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>

- type `Cargo Runner: Cargo Args` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>

- type all the args you want as you would normally do on the command line.

e.g. `--release`

It would be saved on your `settings.json`  as follows

```json
"rust-analyzer.runnables.extraArgs": [
        "--release"
],
```

The Next time you press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> it would run the following command with the args you defined appended to the end.

example command output:

```sh
cargo run --package codec --bin codec --no-default-features --release
```

2. Adding Test Binary Args

- Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>

- type `Cargo Runner: Test Args` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>

- type all the args you want as you would normally do on the command line.

e.g. `--quiet --show-output --color=always --nocapture`

It would be saved on your `settings.json`  as follows

```json
"rust-analyzer.runnables.extraTestBinaryArgs": [
        "--quiet",
        "--show-output",
        "--color=always",
        "--nocapture",
],
```

This would be used for both `cargo test` and `cargo-nextest` when generating the command to run.


example command output:
```sh
cargo test --package codec --bin codec -- tests::it_works --exact --quiet --show-output --color=always --nocapture
```

</br>

> **NOTE**: To check the allowed args for `cargo test` run **cargo test -- --help** in your terminal.

</br>

> **NOTE** To check the allowed args for `cargo-nextest` run **cargo nextest run --help** in your terminal.

</br>

3. Adding ENV vars

- Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>

- type `Cargo Runner: ENV Vars` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>

- type all the env vars you want as you would normally do on the command line.

e.g. `RUST_BACKTRACE=full RUST_LOG=debug`


it would be saved on your `settings.json`  as follows

```json
"rust-analyzer.runnables.extraEnv": {
        "RUST_BACKTRACE": "full",
        "RUST_LOG": "debug"
}
```

4. Adding Features

- Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>

- type `Cargo Runner: Features` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>

- type all the features you want as you would normally do on the command line.

e.g. You can use any of the following formats

- `example default no-default`
- `example,default, no-default` 

it would be saved on your `settings.json`  as follows

```json
"rust-analyzer.cargo.noDefaultFeatures": true,
"rust-analyzer.cargo.features": [
        "example",
        "default"
],
```

The next time you press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> it would run the following command with the features you defined appended to the end.

example command output:

```sh
cargo run --package codec --bin codec --features example --features default --no-default-features
```

**NOTE** : This is not recommended for workspaces setup as any features define here would also be applied to all crates in the workspace.

For better control over features , check [Bonus](#bonus) section.

5. Add Target

- Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
- type `Cargo Runner: Target` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
- type the target you want to use

e.g. `wasm32-unknown-unknown`

It would be saved on your `settings.json`  as follows

`settings.json`
```json
{
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.target": "wasm32-unknown-unknown",
}
```


### Bonus

1. Add rust-analyzer specific target directory **(OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)**

- Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
- type `Cargo Runner: Rust Analyzer Target Dir` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>


It would be saved on your `settings.json`  as follows

```json
{
"rust-analyzer.cargo.targetDir": true,
}
```

This prevents rust-analyzer's cargo check and initial build-script and proc-macro building from locking the Cargo.lock at the expense of duplicating build artifacts.

2. Changing Required features **(Recommended)**

Note: This would only work if you already defined your features on `Cargo.toml`

- Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
- type `Cargo Runner: Required Features` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
- Select from entries from  `examples`, `benches` , `src/bin` or `lib`  
- Press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
- List of available features would be shown
- select the features you want to require
- Press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>


It would update your `Cargo.toml`  as follows

`Cargo.toml`
```toml
[[bin]]
name = "codec"
path = "src/main.rs"
required-features = ["example"]

[features]
default = ["example"]
example = []
```

Note the difference on using `required-features` and `features` from `rust-analyzer.cargo.features` is that you can specifically choose the specific `bin` or `lib` you want to require features for , unlike **overriding** the **rust-analyzer.cargo.features** which can take effect on all `bin` and `lib`.
